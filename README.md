# Gradient-Penalty

This program tests a novel gradient-based penalty method that regularization polynomial regression models fit to functions (namely the Runge function and the step function) that have pathological oscillations at their boundary. The main program is in the file 'experiment.m'. The program provides implementation of standard penalty methods, such as lasso and ridge regression, for comparision to the gradient penalty method.
